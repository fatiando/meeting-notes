Community calls are **open to everyone**! 
Join us if you're interested in the project,
want to find out more,
or just want to chat with fellow coding geoscientists.

During the calls we discuss recent project develpment, 
code/tasks that need attention,
the design of new features,
future directions for the project,
interesting bits of geoscience, and more!
