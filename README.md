## Community Calls

Community calls are **open to everyone**!
Join us if you're interested in the project,
want to find out more,
or just want to chat with fellow coding geoscientists.

During the calls we discuss recent project development,
code/tasks that need attention,
new features,
future directions for the project,
interesting bits of geoscience, and more!
These calls will be relatively **low technical level** and should be accessible
to people at different coding skill levels.

ðŸ“œ The live **meeting notes** can be read and edited by anyone on HackMD
(archived in the `community-calls` folder of this repository):

## Development Calls

We also meet up **weekly** to discuss routine project development:
implementation details, code refactoring, maintenance tasks, documentation,
etc.
Discussions tend to be **more technical** than our Community Calls.

These calls are **open to everyone**!
They are a great way to learn more about day-to-day development and the
internal workings of our code.
It's absolutely fine to join and just listen to what we discuss
but we welcome participation!
