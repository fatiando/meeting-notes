# Notes from Fatiando Community Calls

Decisions taken by the group, discussions, updates, etc, are written down
during the Fatiando Community Calls. These notes are synced to this repository
(see the `community-calls` folder).

**Calls are open to everyone** so please feel free to come along! The time and 
date for calls is usually decided on our [Slack chatroom](http://contact.fatiando.org/).
We also post the link to the video call and any other information needed.

The live notes are taken in HackMD, where anyone can comment/edit: https://hackmd.io/@fatiando/community-calls-2020

The calls are recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/FatiandoOrg

The notes themselves are placed in the public domain using license CC0 (see
the `LICENSE` file).
