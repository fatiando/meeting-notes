Development calls are **open to everyone**! Here we discuss routine project development: implementation details, code refactoring, maintenance tasks, documentation, etc. Discussions tend to be **more technical** than our Community Calls.

**Everyone is encouraged to edit the notes below.**

**Discussion points:**

* Reconcile the Harmonica and Verde gridding API?
    * The EQLHarmonic and Spline APIs are slightly different:
        * `.grid` takes the extra `upward` coordinate in EQLHarmonic
    * Done for a more intuitive and descriptive interface
    * But it means we can't use anything that relies on the Verde API, like `vd.Chain`, `vd.Vector`, and the proposed `vd.Derivative`.
    * Is there a way to keep the `upward` argument and make the APIs compatible again (even if it means changing the Verde API)?

**Quick updates**

* Pooch is using the `sphinx-book-theme` and trying out a new docs layout: [#237](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/237)
* Pooch PR to download from Zenodo and figshare: https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/241
    * Will be useful for refactoring RockHound into our sample data repository
    * Can put every dataset in the same Zenodo/figshare archive and download individual files

**Longer discussion**

* Frequency-domain filters in Harmonica: [#238](https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/238)
    * Two type of functions:
        * Filters: work only in frequency domain. I would like to create a `filter` module where they should live.
            * Takes FFT from xrft and outputs still in frequency domain
            * Mostly for internal use but can be used by others as well
        * Filters will be public but not the wrapped FFT functions
        * Transform and processing functions (derivatives, upward continuation, RTP, etc). 
            * Their arguments and outputs are always in spatial domain.
            * They call xrft, use the filters, and then inverse the transform
    * We should engage with `xrft` and discuss some things regarding their implementation.
        * What `true_amplitude` and `true_phase` mean?
        * Why `lag` is not working properly?
            * Inverse transform removes the absolute value of the coordinates so they are centered at zero
            * Need to shift the coordinates in our own code
            * The `lag` seems like it does this but doesn't work for some reason.
            * Check if the coordinates of input and output match to see if we need to shift
        * Why having `dft` and `fft`? What are the differences between them?
        * Santi may have found some bugs in the phase
        * Engaging with them instead of wrapping everything locally is better for the community as a whole
        * Open an issue to start the conversation
    * Derivatives:
        * Should we add the option to choose between finite difference or FFT derivative for easting and northing?
            * The finite difference can be achieved by `xr.differentiate`.
            * For now, remove the horizontal ones from the PR and leave just the vertical
            * In the docs, use xarray for the horizontal derivatives
        * How about using an argument to specify the direction?
            * Better to have 1 function in the docs
            * But can't auto-complete the direction names in notebooks
        * Directional derivatives could be a usecase for FFT based horizontal derivatives
            * Yu will provide a reference/use case for this that we could base the implementation on
            * Could also be done with finite-differences
        * Need to engage with xarray on their padding function.
            * It doesn't set coordinates (just NaNs) for the padded region
            * This makes xrft angry
            * Not trivial to implement in xarray since their Datasets aren't necessarily regular grids
