    * Harmonica v0.2: https://www.fatiando.org/harmonica/latest/changes.html#version-0-2-1

**Longer discussion**

* What to do with RockHound?
    * We like the name so maybe we can keep it alive
    * We can't really test functions since the downloads take a long time
    * Most data don't have licenses so we can't repackage them to make loading easier
    * Not easy to discover as a Python package
    * Something like DataUnderground is much better
    * It's really used much and hence not developed much
    * Growth would be unsustainable with the current approach
    * Would be better to invest time in DataUnderground instead (like making a Python API for it)
        * Encourage use of licenses for data
        * But this is a separate library, probably under Swung
    * Options: 1) archive it 2) use it as the source of Fatiando sample data (for docs, examples, tutorials)
    * Rockhound can be a way to help open datasets without licenses
    * Need to talk to data owners
    * Could make a rule that we can only include open data
        * If we can get CRUST1 to adopt CC licenses, we could then include it
    * How do we decide what is within scope beyond the license?
        * Would people want to do this?
        * Only add something that is used with one of our projects or tutorials
        * But then do we need a package for that?
        * Having the package allows us to change URLs and issue deprecation warnings if needed.
        * If adding something to rockhound, also add an example to some other project
    * Decision:
        * Keep it 
        * Remove all that's on there
        * Move our sample datasets to it
        * Use this chance to clean up and revisit our data
        * Move existing functions to separate scripts in other repos (they are still useful)
* Andrea expressed interest in [Moulder](https://github.com/fatiando/moulder), the 2D modelling code from the old `fatiando` package. Is anyone interested in trying to get this working on notebooks?
    * There is probably nothing like this out there
    * Needs to be updated to current UI packages
    * Need the talwani code in Harmonica as a backend
    * Advantage of notebooks:
        * Can be run in a hub/binder
        * Can be published as part of the notebook
    * Decision:
        * Nothing, really.
        * The repo is there if anyone wants to give this a go.
* xrft can now be used to implement frequency domain processing in Harmonica
    * A lot of demand for FFT based processing from users
    * They are a popular part of the old `fatiando`
    * Some of the filters we had there were much more sophisticated than other existing code
    * Open issues for each filter that we want to implement
    * Most functions would take few inputs
    * Input space or frequency domain grids?
        * Go with space domain for now
        * If we find a use case for frequency domain, we can make separate functions and call them from the space domain ones
    * Padding?
        *  Apply inside or outside the function?
        *  Inside is easier for users
        *  Can always do 0 padding if you want to do it yourself
    *  Start with no padding and then add the feature in future PRs/releases
    *  Decision:
        *  Create the issues for each filters that we want
        *  Start with ones we already had in `fatiando`
        *  Implement each filter without padding
        *  After we have them, then we start thinking about padding
* Should we record the meetings?
    * Can be problematic if people are (rightfully) concerned about harassment
    * Who's watching 1h of video?
    * Never more than 40 views / video
    * People can read the notes
    * We can be better at taking notes
    * Instead of recording:
        * Yearly or twice yearly public meetings
        * Just updates, no discussion
        * Small demos of new features
        * Informal and can invite people to non-recorded meetings
        * No schedule for these, just do one when we accumulate releases
        * Invite new contributors to show off or help with the notebook
        * Fatiando Community Showcase! :tada: 
    * Decision:
        * We won't record anymore (this is the last one)
        * We will keep more complete notes for people who couldn't attend
        * We may try Gather Town next time to see if it's a bit more engaging (not another Zoom call)
