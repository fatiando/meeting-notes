**Date:** 2020/06/19 - 15:00 (UTC)

**Youtube recording:** https://youtu.be/DQwfsRXoPd0

**Participants:**

* Martin Bentley
* Dan Shapero
* Santiago Soler
* Leo Uieda

**Quick updates**

* From Transform 2020:
    * Verde tutorial: https://youtu.be/-xZdNdvzm3E
    * Leo and Santiago's lightning talks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtBDf7d7mwM
* Pooch is being used by SHTools and they want feedback on gravity datasets for Earth: https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/pull/231
    
**Longer discussion**t

* Should Verde transition to "spatial machine learning" more generally?
    * We already have a lot of the machinery required (BlockReduce, cross-validation, etc)
    * The Spline is already a wrapper for Ridge and LinearRegression
    * Gridders would be kept as they are. The idea would be build some things that would make it easier to use scikit-learn without the gridder API.
    * [#268](https://github.com/fatiando/verde/issues/268) and related issues would get us very close to that
    * The cross-validation in particular is very useful for things that aren't gridding
    * Building Jacobians for Spline and Trend could be made into scikit-learn preprocessors. In fact, there is already [PolynomialFeatures](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) for Trend so we could make a `SplineFeatures`.
* Transition sample data into RockHound:
    * Would replace the `datasets` modules in packages.
    * Easier to reuse the data between packages.
    * Needs to have minimal required dependencies (probably just pooch with everything else being optional)
    * Boost usage of RockHound
    * Packages need to be careful pinning the RockHound version for building docs. Don't want the docs changing without us noticing by unintentional upgrades.
    * Data for which we have rights we can process/compress and store in Zenodo. Others we can contact original authors for permission or maybe encourage them to upload to Zenodo.
    * Start migrating the datasets to Zenodo and the `fetch` functions to RockHound.
    * Need a commit to Harmonica and Verde to deprecate the `datasets` modules once this is done.t

**Quick updates**

- Leo:
    * Giving a 3h Verde tutorial at [Transform 2020](https://transform2020.sched.com/): https://github.com/fatiando/transform2020
        * Anyone interested in helping (monitor the chat for questions mostly)?
    * New cross-validation methods in Verde.
    * Bug in Pooch when running in parallel (found in scikit-image) [see this PR](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/pull/173).
        * Fixed in v1.1.1 yesterday
    
**Longer discussion**

- Should we remove default density from Bouguer correction in Harmonica? Forgetting to change them can lead to tricky errors (for example, leaving the water density for Mars). And in Python *explicit is better than implicit* :slightly_smiling_face: 
    - Might be too specific a problem so worth keeping the default values?
    - Could we somehow remind the user that defaults are being used? Probably hard to do in a library but UIs should do this.
    - Maybe confusion is coming from the name `density_water`. Maybe change to density below the reference. 
    - Decision is making it easier vs making it right.
    - Compromise would be have defaults but rename arguments to above and below.
- Bouguer and atmospheric correction pull request. Trickier than it seems. https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/168
- How to organize package maintainers? Should we have a clear mechanism for becoming one and also for stepping down? What would that look like? See https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/issues/14
    - Chris has experience with this for course material.
    - Make a private channel on slack to discuss asking people to be maintainers. Leave it informal for now.
- How to manage more than 2 dimensions on Verde and Harmonica gridders?
    - PRs in Verde to expand to 3D.
    - Equivalent layers are causing problems with assumptions in Verde because the need an extra height argument.
    - Solution might be to have a new base class just for Harmonica equivalent layers.
    - Leo M: Bane might be working on something similar. Worth looking into this. Something with 3D splines in PyVista.
    - Even if we don't do full 3D we still need the height for EQL.
    - Ideally we wanted just a magic solution to not need a new base class.
    - Probably doesn't exits :slightly_frowning_face: 
- Create a shared `fatiando-data` package or move sample data to RockHound? A lot of our packages have sample data in `datasets` modules. But there is no reason that they couldn't share the data without depending on each other. Moving all of them to the same package would make it easier to do this. Having them in `fatiando-data` would separate the sample data (which we sometimes crop/downsample) from the real data in RockHound.
    - There is a LOT of public domain data here: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/geodas/trackline.html  (marine gravity, bathymetry, magnetics and airborne magnetics)
    - Could we make the package but still keep the individual packages. Would just have to `from fatiando_data import *`
    - But the package would be a mandatory dependency in this case, which we might want to avoid.
- New `fatiando` meta-package that includes Verde, Pooch, Harmonica, Boule and Rockhound?
    - Previous Fatiando users will complain that they don't get the `fatiando` Python library.
    - Could help the project feel like a single project instead of individual packages.
    - Another things would be to have a Fatiando wide tutorial that brings all the packages together.
    - Could be done in a separate repo backed by Binder and a notebook or two.
