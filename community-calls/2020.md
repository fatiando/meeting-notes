**Quick updates**

- Leo:
    * Giving a 3h Verde tutorial at [Transform 2020](https://transform2020.sched.com/): https://github.com/fatiando/transform2020
        * Anyone interested in helping (monitor the chat for questions mostly)?
    * New cross-validation methods in Verde.
    
**Longer discussion**

- Should we remove default density from Bouguer correction in Harmonica? Forgetting to change them can lead to tricky errors (for example, leaving the water density for Mars). And in Python *explicit is better than implicit* :slightly_smiling_face: 
- How to organize package maintainers? Should we have a clear mechanism for becoming one and also for stepping down? What would that look like? See https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/issues/14

**Notes**

- First ever community call :confetti_ball:
