## 2020-07-16

**YouTube recording:** https://youtu.be/GJIeDxWHaN0

**Participants:**

* Leo Uieda
* Santiago Soler
* Martin Bentley

**Quick updates**

* **Next meeting date:** 2020/08/13 - 19:00 UTC
* Request for a new tips/tricks section in Pooch docs [#188](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch/issues/188) (need a good name for this)
* New Pooch user: [histolab](https://github.com/histolab/histolab) :confetti_ball: 
    
**Longer discussion**

* Roadmap for Boule 1.0
    * Ellipsoids for all rocky planets
    * `Sphere` class for normal gravity calculation (should be basic physics). Moon and some others have 0 flatenning, which breaks the normal gravity equations for ellipsoids. 
    * Separate normal gravity into gravitational and centrifugal parts. Need to check equations to see how to do that.
    * Ask SHTools what other things they need
    * [poliastro](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/stable/)  (astrodynamics package) expressed [interest in using Boule as well](https://twitter.com/poliastro_py/status/1283052225921679361?s=20). Check with them what they might need that is currently missing.
    * JOSS paper once that is finished. If we focus efforts, could be done relatively soon. 
* Roadmap for Verde 2.0
    * Create an issue and milestone
    * What needs to be done? Any other major deprecations?
    * Prepare PRs for all deprecations but only merge ready for the release
    * Should probably wait until data are moved to RockHound
    * Make a new paper (JOSS or we can try another journal)
    * Opportunity for new contributors to get some credit
* Hamonica status
    * What are some key missing features?
    * FFT based processing with xrft needs some thought (Martin has started a prototype)
        * Might be good to make an effort to get derivatives, etc, in Harmonica since this was a major feature in `fatiando`
    * EQLs will have a common base class, subclass of Verde's BaseGridder. Overrides `grid`, `scatter` and `profile` methods.
    * Ditch spherical EQL and replace it with geodetic EQL (after new function for Euclidean distance between points in geodetic coordinates).
    * The page about coordinates is really needed at this point.
    * Forward modeling of layers/interfaces (needed for topographic correction and basin/Moho inversions)
* Rockhound latest news
    * Rockhound will gather all functions to fetch sample data from Fatiando ([#84](https://github.com/fatiando/rockhound/pull/84))
    * Need to deprecate `verde.datasets` and `harmonica.datasets` modules.
        * Deprecation in Verde should be done in v2.0
        * Deprecation in Harmonica can be done right away (hurray for 0.* versions :tada:)
    * Need to check if Zenodo allows download of single files from an archive. If so, we can upload all sample data to a single archive. Otherwise, we'll need separate archives for each dataset.
    * Leo will look into using PyGMT in RockHound
* [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#nep-29-recommend-python-and-numpy-version-support-as-a-community-policy-standard) for Python and Numpy version support
    * Next release of our packages would drop Python <= 3.6
    * Specify minimum required numpy on all packages as well
    * Would be good for Verde, Harmonica, RockHound to free up CI time. 
    * Pooch and Boule need to be careful because of users and tests are usually quick anyway.
    * Need to make issues for this in Verde and Harmonica and then update the docs and CI builds.
* Use GitHub Actions to automate changelog generation
    * Release Drafter: https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/issues/15
    * **Need to be more diligent with PR titles and assign labels to PRs** (comment on issue above to discuss protocols)
    * Changelog generation would basically be copying from GitHub and using a `sed` command
    * Contributors and sorting of changes is automatic
        * Tags: documentation; bug; maintenance; (new) feature; deprecation; (internal) enhancement
    * There is still oportunity for manual curation of the changelog
    * Rockhound will be our rat lab for this
* Make a section on developer guide about transitioning into a maintainer role
    * Based on call discussions and https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/issues/14
    * Asking people interested to step up to review PRs as a start
    * Could outline 2 pathways: making PRs for code and docs work or reviewing PRs
    * Leave for later discussion
* Move away from "master" on GitHub
    * Could move it to "main"
    * Might need to be a bit careful to replace all occurances of "master" in docs, tests, CI scripts etc.
    * Start with smaller packages like Boule and then try Pooch (which might be the most troublesome).
    * Once all are converted we can update the contributing and maintenace guides

## 2020-06-19

**Date:** 2020/06/19 - 15:00 (UTC)

**Youtube recording:** https://youtu.be/DQwfsRXoPd0

**Participants:**

* Martin Bentley
* Dan Shapero
* Santiago Soler
* Leo Uieda

**Quick updates**

* From Transform 2020:
    * Verde tutorial: https://youtu.be/-xZdNdvzm3E
    * Leo and Santiago's lightning talks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtBDf7d7mwM
* Pooch is being used by SHTools and they want feedback on gravity datasets for Earth: https://github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS/pull/231
    
**Longer discussion**

* Should Verde transition to "spatial machine learning" more generally?
    * We already have a lot of the machinery required (BlockReduce, cross-validation, etc)
    * The Spline is already a wrapper for Ridge and LinearRegression
    * Gridders would be kept as they are. The idea would be build some things that would make it easier to use scikit-learn without the gridder API.
    * [#268](https://github.com/fatiando/verde/issues/268) and related issues would get us very close to that
    * The cross-validation in particular is very useful for things that aren't gridding
    * Building Jacobians for Spline and Trend could be made into scikit-learn preprocessors. In fact, there is already [PolynomialFeatures](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) for Trend so we could make a `SplineFeatures`.
* Transition sample data into RockHound:
    * Would replace the `datasets` modules in packages.
    * Easier to reuse the data between packages.
    * Needs to have minimal required dependencies (probably just pooch with everything else being optional)
    * Boost usage of RockHound
    * Packages need to be careful pinning the RockHound version for building docs. Don't want the docs changing without us noticing by unintentional upgrades.
    * Data for which we have rights we can process/compress and store in Zenodo. Others we can contact original authors for permission or maybe encourage them to upload to Zenodo.
    * Start migrating the datasets to Zenodo and the `fetch` functions to RockHound.
    * Need a commit to Harmonica and Verde to deprecate the `datasets` modules once this is done.t

        * Fixed in v1.1.1 yesterday
    
**Longer discussion**

- Should we remove default density from Bouguer correction in Harmonica? Forgetting to change them can lead to tricky errors (for example, leaving the water density for Mars). And in Python *explicit is better than implicit* :slightly_smiling_face: 
    - Might be too specific a problem so worth keeping the default values?
    - Could we somehow remind the user that defaults are being used? Probably hard to do in a library but UIs should do this.
    - Maybe confusion is coming from the name `density_water`. Maybe change to density below the reference. 
    - Decision is making it easier vs making it right.
    - Compromise would be have defaults but rename arguments to above and below.
- Bouguer and atmospheric correction pull request. Trickier than it seems. https://github.com/fatiando/harmonica/pull/168
- How to organize package maintainers? Should we have a clear mechanism for becoming one and also for stepping down? What would that look like? See https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/issues/14
    - Chris has experience with this for course material.
    - Make a private channel on slack to discuss asking people to be maintainers. Leave it informal for now.
- How to manage more than 2 dimensions on Verde and Harmonica gridders?
    - PRs in Verde to expand to 3D.
    - Equivalent layers are causing problems with assumptions in Verde because the need an extra height argument.
    - Solution might be to have a new base class just for Harmonica equivalent layers.
    - Leo M: Bane might be working on something similar. Worth looking into this. Something with 3D splines in PyVista.
    - Even if we don't do full 3D we still need the height for EQL.
    - Ideally we wanted just a magic solution to not need a new base class.
    - Probably doesn't exits :slightly_frowning_face: 
- Create a shared `fatiando-data` package or move sample data to RockHound? A lot of our packages have sample data in `datasets` modules. But there is no reason that they couldn't share the data without depending on each other. Moving all of them to the same package would make it easier to do this. Having them in `fatiando-data` would separate the sample data (which we sometimes crop/downsample) from the real data in RockHound.
    - There is a LOT of public domain data here: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/geodas/trackline.html  (marine gravity, bathymetry, magnetics and airborne magnetics)
    - Could we make the package but still keep the individual packages. Would just have to `from fatiando_data import *`
    - But the package would be a mandatory dependency in this case, which we might want to avoid.
- New `fatiando` meta-package that includes Verde, Pooch, Harmonica, Boule and Rockhound?
    - Previous Fatiando users will complain that they don't get the `fatiando` Python library.
    - Could help the project feel like a single project instead of individual packages.
    - Another things would be to have a Fatiando wide tutorial that brings all the packages together.
    - Could be done in a separate repo backed by Binder and a notebook or two.
